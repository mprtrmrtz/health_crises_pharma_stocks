## Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of significant health crises on pharmaceutical stock performance, employing a comprehensive analysis incorporating macroeconomic and market indicators. Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, we evaluate the effects of thirteen major health events since 2000, including the Anthrax attacks, SARS outbreak, H1N1 pandemic, and COVID-19 pandemic, on the pharmaceutical sector. The analysis covers different phases of each event — beginning, peak, and ending — to capture their temporal influence on stock prices. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in stock performance, driven by market reactions to the initial news, peak impact, and eventual resolution of these crises. We also examine scenarios with and without key macroeconomic (MA) and market (MI) indicators to isolate their contributions. This detailed examination provides valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and stakeholders in understanding the interplay between health crises and health market dynamics, guiding better decision-making during future health-related disruptions.
